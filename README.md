# dynamic-grasping
Project folder of a group of ROS 2 packages of a control system to let a robotic arm (WidowX 250 S, by Trossen Robotics) grasp objects in relative motion with respect to the base of the arm. The control system is also able to dynamically adapt to sudden changes in the perceived motion of the object.
